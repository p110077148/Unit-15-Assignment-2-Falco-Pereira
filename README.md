## 1. Design Documentation
### Wireframe
![alt text](image-3.png)

As per the requirements for the website i created wireframes for 5 main pages using figma for Hot Beans Recruitment, covering the following requirements by the client;
● A profile of the company itself
● profiles of existing trainee web developers
● job specifications and required qualifications
● an on-line application form
● links to web development courses

I created them with the use of bootstrap in mind and they should be easily implemented and responsive once created using bootstrap.

### User Flow Diagram

a

# 115/B.M2 Justify the design decisions, explaining how they will meet the users needs and be fit for purpose.

A User Flow Diagram was created using figma to show how a user will navigate the web pages, from the user flow diagram you can see that the first page will be the home page, after that the user can navigate to all other pages as each section will be interconnected for a more user friendly experience, navigation will be smooth and fluid, a decision is then placed at the Job Apply page where if a user applies they will be redirected to the home page and if they do not apply they will be kept on the job apply page unless they chose to navigate elsewhere.

### Client Requirement Analysis
15/B.M2 Justify the design decisions, explaining how they will meet the users needs and be fit for purpose.
The client Hot Beans Web has asked to have a new section on their website with the goal of helping to recruit new trainees as web developers. Because of this the goal of the section will be to have a webpage that will attract people who are already or training to become web developers, these could be people who are training, or already fully qualified and looking for a new challenge.

Hot Beans has also requested that the following is added; 

● A profile of the company itself
● profiles of existing trainee web developers
● job specifications and required qualifications
● an on-line application form
● links to web development courses

Because of this i have come up with a blueprint for a great webpage that should achieve the goal by doing the following;

We will have a homepage (Landing Page) that will have a clean layout and catch the eye of the user with a link to the company page
A Company Page that will tell users what the company is about to make users want to delve deeper into the site


A Trainee Page that will show some current trainees with images, names and roles


A Job Specification page which will list current jobs and their description 


A Job Apply page which will allow users to apply online for a desired role 


A Courses page which will allow users to click on links to online courses that could help them increase their likelihood of being hired and also increase their knowledge base

In addition to this the site will be using the latest version of Bootstrap which will help the site be responsive and fluid in its navigation and help make sure that users using the site are able to navigate easily.

### Colour Schemes and Typography
![alt text](image-2.png)








# 15/B.M2 Justify the design decisions, explaining how they will meet the users needs and be fit for purpose.

These are the choices I made after doing research and looking at other sites, these choices will make sure that the website I create will look sleek, professional and modern which will help users who desire to be website developers to look at the website and see something that will inspire them and make them more likely to apply. This not only helps the website look good but also meet the clients requirements.

The primary will be blue for buttons and links which I think will look nice with the colour scheme I am going for. Then i went with a light grey background and dark grey text which will help give a contrast to things, as someone who is completely color blind, i found these colours easy to read which will help the website be more user friendly and have better accessibility and finally i will use an accent colour for the application button which will be green.

Then for typography i went with poppins for headings and headings text which i think will look nice and modern and i went with roboto for the body text on the website, again for the same reason, these are both clean modern fonts, on top of that they are easy to read which will help the website be more accessible and from my research i found that they meet modern website design standards which means the website will look nice and modern and professional and both fonts are available on google.

All the colours and fonts were also chosen as they will work with bootstrap without creating further issues and make creating the website easier and more streamlines while also making sure it looks professional, clean and modern while being responsive and meeting the clients requirements which is how i justify the decision i have made.

To conclude the decision i have made in the design process will not only meet the clients need but also the users needs and is fit for purpose, it provide the ability to find free courses, learn about the company, their employees and also apply for job openings while also remaining clean and professional which will help both both meet the clients needs and requirements but also the needs and requirements of the user, showing that it is fit for purpose.



15/B.P3 Review the website design proposals with others to identify and inform improvements.
To ensure i meet the clients requirements i made sure to review the design proposals, i did this by emailing a senior web developer within the organisation in order to ensure that my work was up to standard, i emailed them within business hours and according to the project plan i laid out, this helps ensure that i am demonstrating both individual responsibility and effective self management in the development and review of a website


Here you can see the email correspondence I sent which shows professional language while also being polite, explaining what I have provided to streamline the review process and also to ensure that I am demonstrating individual responsibility and effective self management.



Here you can see the reply, the reply stated i needed to change some things with the wireframe as well as a colour in the colour schemes and typography. To show my creativity as well as my effective self management I started on these changes right away.

To add onto this the request was to remove the jobs tab, and i took it upon myself to add a navigation bar/button in order to better optimise the design which shows both my creativity and effective self management in the design of the website and documentation, i also removed the CV link as requested, ensured home was in the top left of all pages and changed the colour of the apply button to blue as requested with the new documentation seen below.

Here you can see i emailed the senior web developer in order to make sure the changes were up to scratch and also to make them aware of a change i made on my own (Navigation bar/button)

Here you can see that they were happy with the changes made and also thought the navigation button idea was a great idea and since all the design documentation was good after a review and with changes made, I then moved onto creating the website.

15/C.P6 Review the extent to which the website meets client requirements.

This website was created as a request from Hot Beans Web, the goal and purpose of it was to attract aspiring web developers and designers who had recently finished their training or qualifications or were previously experienced and were looking for a job as a web developer. To do this they asked for a new section to their website. I will now review the project against the clients requirements and after a review will decide if any changes need to be made and if so I will then proceed to optimise the website and do the necessary changes.

Client Requirements
Company Profile
The new section needed to have a dedicated company profile gate, this page was created as company.html using bootstrap and vs code as well as all of the other pages, the page shows users Hot Beans Web’s goals, background, clients and contact information as well as their logo and offices which meets the clients requirements and allows users to learn about Hot Beans Web.
Trainees Profile
The new section needed to have a dedicated trainees page that was created under trainees.html, the page shows images of current trainees as well as a description of the current trainees which helps people connect with them without meeting them but also meets the clients requirements
Job Specifications
The new section needed to have a dedicated jobs specification section, this was created and split between 2 pages under jobs.html apply.html. jobs.html has images of 2 trainees and an example project as well as a description of both the web designer and web developer roles which meet the clients requirements
Apply Section
This was the second part as a requirement was also an online application form, this was created under apply.html, it allows you to select between available roles, and once selected, a drop down will appear giving a full job description along with pay and an online application form at the bottom with working validation to aid accessibility, this along with the jobs.html fully meets the clients requirements.
Course Links
Finally a section needed to have a dedicated to course links, this was created under courses.html and shows working links with small descriptions of 6 free online courses which fully meets the requirements of the client while also giving users help and options for advancing their knowledge and career.


Additional Work
Privacy
This was not a requirement from the client however to ensure that the client is compliant with GDPR and meets regulations, I decided to integrate a privacy policy for GDPR into the footer with a working link, this will help our client meet regulations and be in full compliance with law and regulation as well as help users understand Hot Beans privacy policy which is important and is in my opinion a must have for any reputable web development company.
Social Media
Another thing that I did, that was done to demonstrate my individual responsibility, creativity and effective self-management in the design, development and review of a website was to create an integrated social media icon with a working link that will direct a user to the client's social media account. This is in my opinion important especially in our day and age where social media is integrated into people's lives and as such I ensured to integrate the clients social media into the footer on the opposite side of the privacy policy.
Landing Page
Another thing that I did, that was done to demonstrate my individual responsibility, creativity and effective self-management in the design, development and review of a website was to create a landing page with a small description stating the client is recruiting with an apply button that will redirect them to the application page, apply.html. I did this as some people might be repeat visitors or not want to go through the whole page and just want to apply, this will help users and returning users save time but also have a nice, clean professional landing page that won't bombard a user with company information which further helps meet the clients requirements in my opinion.
Target audience and Purpose
The new section I made uses a simple, yet clean and responsive navigation design that is accessible to all kinds of users


The content on the pages, like pictures and descriptions and resources are catered around developers of all levels but easily understandable by users who have only recently passed their training and qualifications.


The new section works on multiple devices and operating systems while remaining responsive and working well


The online application has tooltips and live error notifications to help accessibility issues while also making the application process simpler






Places to Improve
The main places to improve are going to be where issues were found in testing, these improvements are;

Footer won't stay at the bottom of the page

This can be fixed and improved by fixing the code to ensure the bar stays at the bottom of the page always


When using the keyboard only. Menu won't drop on tab and you can select role to apply either

This can be fixed and improved by fixing the code and ensuring the menu is also clickable not just hoverable and roles can be selected with a keyboard


Job roles to apply for were hard to see if they were highlighted because of the sites colour scheme

This can be fixed by either changing the sections colour scheme or by making the highlight darker to ensure better visibility


 Text felt a bit untidy

This can be fixed and improved by fixing the code and ensuring the text is formatted/aligned correctly


Colour scheme felt outdated

This can be fixed by changing the colour scheme however it was a personal opinion and other users might feel different, however because of the highlighted job roles it might be worth it to change the colour scheme
Conclusion
To conclude my review i believe that the site does meet the clients requirements to the fullest extent, the website is smart, professional and clean, it is functional and has the correct content to meet the clients requirements with elements that help the site be responsive and feel professional, it is also easy to navigate and understand, user friendly and very accessible. However, as mentioned there are improvements and optimisations that could be made to further improve the site based on feedback from users and testing.

15/BC.D2 Evaluate the design and optimised website against client requirements.

Final Evaluation

This project was a delight to work on and really enjoyable however with that being said to have a strong evaluation its important to go back and look at the strengths and weaknesses of the website
Strengths
First let's look at the strengths

All requirements were met and all features are built into the site


Modern, dark themed design which has a consistent colour theme


Responsive layout that was tested on multiple devices and browsers


Application form with live validation checks


Clean, modern expandable sections


Website is very accessible and provides features like a good contrast and keyboard navigation
Weaknesses
Now lets look at the weaknesses

There were difficulties with spacing in some areas and alignment on tablet devices, in particular ipad models


Images are not 100% the intended size and aligned to my satisfaction


Some parts of the site use custom styles which could cause issues down the road
Future improvements
Finally lets look at where we can improve for next time.


I could use fancier, more advanced things like animations and transitions to make the website more interactive and fun to use


I could implement a better form submission with more options


Improved submission handling


I Could create user accounts so that applications could be logged and tracked

After looking at my original work and then the changes that I made I can say with confidence that the final version of the Hot Beans Web website meets all of the clients requirements that were outlined for my project. The site has all of the content asked of the client and more, it has an easy to understand and clean company profile, a trainees profile page with images and descriptions so users can get a good understanding as well as interactive text boxes that help the text not clutter the entire screen line the original design. 

There is a detailed job specifications page that outlines the work employees carry out and also an online application that provides boxes to select for the job description as well as a form with live validation and finally a courses page that provides a number of free online courses for those who wish to learn and improve their skill base and knowledge.

Accessibility, responsiveness and compatibility were key factors when creating this site, the website uses bootstrap and is very responsive but also has accessibility features like being able to use it on just a keyboard as well as a good colour contrast and strong fonts that help the site be easily readable for the visually impaired.

The site was also tested on multiple devices, different browsers, different operating systems and different types of devices like tablets, smartphones, i pads and desktops, all resolutions adjust depending on the device thanks to bootstrap's grid system and the adjustments made in the code which provides a consistency regardless of the device the site is being viewed on.
